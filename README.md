# Time_Lord
This is a assignment that I did in KIT_607(Mobile Application Development) When I was in the University. The main idea of this assignemnt is to create a time management program system.This is a team project. I mainly responsible for the coding part.In the assignment, we learnt how to design a prototype of the application to set up a solid fundation at the begining.Then, it is program part,Our teacher recommend us to use Objective C to program this application.However, once our teacher give us a brief introduction about Swift in one of the lecture, I decided to use Swift to program my assignment.
Since our teacher did not teach Swift in the class, I start to learn it myself. It took me 8days to learn and build up the application. I was totally into it on that time. I worked 12hours a day during these 8days to finish my project. In the end, with my passion and hardwork, our teacher give us good response as return. 
There is teacher's comment below:

Good presentation, though went overtime a little - obviously invested and excited to share the app, which is great! Brief explanation of goals; testing was discussed though there was no usability testing. There was a vary detailed walk though, solid app w
Love the style of your app and the obvious effort you put into it! Love the extra features like the extra task categories. Good use of OS UI elements including swipe to delete and the + button. Bit disorientating when the app goes back to the main page after you add a new task from the 'events' section - tasks added via this button also don't appear to save?? The sorting options in 'timetable' also aren't working at present, and there's a bug that means the current tasks don't show up properly on the main view page until you change the background! Good ability to edit tasks. Like the quiz, particularly the tailored image on the last page! Would have been good to have had some explanation of what the score they received meant. Good use of persistent storage. Would have been good to have used the same importance/urgency matrix as the task sheet. Over all though it's a pretty user friendly app with obvious thought put into it - well done guys!
Nice app name -TimeLord!, but there is definitely room for improvement in the report. Mind the grammar, particularly for the test tasks that are being shown to end-users. Test tasks need to be clear and measurable (e.g. T1. what assignment). Mention any assumptions at start of testing too (e.g. is the app preloaded with data?). Requirements are a little too detailed (making it hard for a tester to do all of these). Never mention actual names in a publication - these are to remain anonymous! References aren't cited in the report. Prototype screenshots are very broad - fitness? errands? job? - It is important to keep within the scope of the assignment.
Regards, Rainer.
